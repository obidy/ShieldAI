# ShieldAI
FOR WOMEN BY WOMEN
Inspiration The inspiration behind ShieldAI comes from the global struggle women face when reporting rape and sexual assault. Many women are silenced due to fear of stigma, privacy concerns, and distrust in authorities. ShieldAI was created to give survivors a secure, anonymous platform to speak out and access support without the risk of retaliation. By leveraging AI, we aim to reduce these barriers and empower women globally.

What it does ShieldAI provides a safe, anonymous way for women to report sexual assault incidents. It uses AI to categorize reports, analyze geographic trends, and offer real-time resources like legal aid and psychological support. The platform ensures privacy and helps connect survivors to local authorities and global networks of assistance, without compromising their identity or safety.

How we built it We developed ShieldAI using React Native for the mobile app and Node.js for the backend. The AI component, powered by NLP and sentiment analysis, was built using Python. We used MongoDB to store encrypted data and implemented end-to-end encryption to ensure user privacy. Cloud services like AWS allowed us to scale the app for global reach.

Challenges we ran into Ensuring complete anonymity while maintaining security was a major challenge. We also faced difficulties in building a global resource network for legal and psychological aid. Another hurdle was creating an AI that could accurately categorize sensitive reports across different languages and cultures.

Accomplishments that we're proud of We successfully created a secure, user-friendly platform that prioritizes privacy. The AI's ability to analyze reports and detect high-risk zones is a significant achievement, as it can help identify trends in sexual violence and inform targeted interventions. Our partnership with NGOs and legal organizations for global support is another proud accomplishment.

What we learned We learned that building trust is key in sensitive platforms like ShieldAI. Ensuring security, privacy, and an empathetic user experience is essential to encourage survivors to come forward. We also gained a deeper understanding of global legal frameworks related to sexual assault reporting.

What's next for ShieldAI Next, we aim to expand ShieldAI's reach by partnering with more local organizations worldwide. We plan to refine the AI for even more accurate geographic insights and support predictions. Additionally, weâ€™ll continue working on multilingual support to ensure accessibility for women everywhere.
